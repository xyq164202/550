My design is a distributed hash table system. It has no central server, each peer is both a server and a client. As a client, it provides interfaces through which users can issue queries and view search results. As a server, it accepts queries from other peers, checks for matches against its local hash table, and responds with corresponding results. In addition, since thereâ€™s no central indexing server, search is done through consistent hashing. In this evaluation, it tells it works not bad on cloud environment from latency and throughput.
